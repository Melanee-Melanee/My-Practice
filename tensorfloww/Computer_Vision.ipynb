This means we can use a pretrained CNN, one trained on millions of images, as the start of our model. This will allow us to have a very good convolutional base before adding our own dense layered classifier at the end. In fact, by using this techique we can train a very good classifier for a realtively small dataset (< 10,000 images). This is because the convnet already has a very good idea of what features to look for in an image and can find them very effectively. So, if we can determine the presence of features all the rest of the model needs to do is determine which combination of features makes a specific image.\n",
