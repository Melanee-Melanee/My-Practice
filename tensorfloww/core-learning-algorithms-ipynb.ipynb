The closest centroid to a point is the one it is assigned to.\n- Step 3: Average all the points belonging to each centroid to find the middle of those clusters (center of mass). Place the corresponding centroids into that position.\n- Step 4: Reassign every point once again to the closest centroid.\n- Step 5: Repeat steps 3-4 until no point changes which centroid it belongs to.\n\n*Please refer to the video for an explanation of KMeans clustering.*","metadata":{"id":"d0dfaT4esRh3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##Hidden Markov Models\n\n\"The Hidden Markov Model is a finite set of states, each of which is associated with a (generally multidimensional) probability distribution [].

We'll run through an example in a second that should clear some things up, but let's discuss the components of a markov model.\n\n**States:** In each markov model we have a finite set of states. These states could be something like \"warm\" and \"cold\" or \"high\" and \"low\" or even \"red\", \"green\" and \"blue\". These states are \"hidden\" within the model, which means we do not direcly observe them.\n\n**Observations:** Each state has a particular outcome or observation associated with it based on a probability distribution. An example of this is the following: *On a hot day Tim has a 80% chance of being happy and a 20% chance of being sad.*\n\n**Transitions:** Each state will have a probability defining the likelyhood of transitioning to a different state. An example is the following: *a cold day has a 30% chance of being followed by a hot day and a 70% chance of being follwed by another cold day.*\n\nTo create a hidden markov model we need.\n- States\n- Observation Distribution\n- Transition Distribution\n\nFor our purpose we will assume we already have this information available as we attempt to predict the weather on a given day.","metadata":{"id":"RKJSFk4NP0eq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"###Imports and Setup","metadata":{"id":"iK2QbOzr6jNJ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%tensorflow_version 2.x  # this line is not required unless you are in a notebook","metadata":{"id":"Suf1v8kJ6niA","outputId":"f12c7178-cc43-42cd-92c3-8084d5d61637"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Due to a version mismatch with tensorflow v2 and tensorflow_probability we need to install the most recent version of tensorflow_probability (see below).","metadata":{"id":"GN_Fkrx30xbb"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install tensorflow_probability==0.8.0rc0 --user --upgrade","metadata":{"id":"kawrMHKGBWyS","outputId":"ad6d30ff-e53a-4776-825d-c18e2b0728cc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import tensorflow_probability as tfp  # We are using a different module from tensorflow this time\nimport tensorflow as tf","metadata":{"id":"mEIk7FYD6lcF"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"###Weather Model\nTaken direclty from the TensorFlow documentation (https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/distributions/HiddenMarkovModel). \n\nWe will model a simple weather system and try to predict the temperature on each day given the following information.\n1.
