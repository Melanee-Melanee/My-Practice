A common example of NLP is something like spellcheck or autocomplete. Essentially NLP is the field that focuses on how computers can understand and/or process natural/human languages. \n","\n","### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\n","\n","In this tutorial we will introduce a new kind of neural network that is much more capable of processing sequential data such as text or characters called a **recurrent neural network** (RNN for short). \n","\n","We will learn how to use a reccurent neural network to do the following:\n","- Sentiment Analysis\n","- Character Generation \n","\n","RNN's are complex and come in many different forms so in this tutorial we wil focus on how they work and the kind of problems they are best suited for.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"094ac937","metadata":{"id":"ur_FQq-Q-fxC","papermill":{"duration":0.019806,"end_time":"2022-07-23T05:21:34.404725","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-07-23T05:21:34.384919","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Sequence Data\n","In the previous tutorials we focused on data that we could represent as one static data point where the notion of time or step was irrelevant. Take for example our image data, it was simply a tensor of shape (width, height, channels). That data doesn't change or care about the notion of time. \n","\n","In this tutorial we will look at sequences of text and learn how we can encode them in a meaningful way. Unlike images, sequence data such as \n","<span style=\"color:green;\"> \n","    long chains of text, weather patterns, videos \n","</span> \n","and really anything where the notion of a step or time is relevant needs to be processed and handled in a special way. \n","\n","But what do I mean by sequences and why is text data a sequence? Well that's a good question. Since textual data contains many words that follow in a very specific and meaningful order, we need to be able to keep track of each word and when it occurs in the data. Simply encoding say an entire paragraph of text into one data point wouldn't give us a very meaningful picture of the data and would be very difficult to do anything with. This is why we treat text as a sequence and process one word at a time. We will keep track of where each of these words appear and use that information to try to understand the meaning of peices of text.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"33c1812f","metadata":{"id":"8gQHK4V4e2wl","papermill":{"duration":0.0209,"end_time":"2022-07-23T05:21:34.445709","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-07-23T05:21:34.424809","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Encoding Text\n","As we know machine learning models and neural networks don't take raw text data as an input.

This is because of the **ordering** of words, a very important property of textual data.\n","\n","Now keep that in mind while we consider some different ways of encoding our textual data.\n","\n","### Bag of Words\n","The first and simplest way to encode our data is to use something called **bag of words**. This is a pretty easy technique where each word in a sentence is encoded with an integer and thrown into a collection that does not maintain the order of the words but does keep track of the frequency. Have a look at the python function below that encodes a string of text into bag of words.

Up until this point we have been using something called **feed-forward** neural networks. This simply means that all our data is fed forwards (all at once) from left to right through the network. This was fine for the problems we considered before but won't work very well for processing text. After all, even we (humans) don't process text all at once. We read word by word from left to right and keep track of the current meaning of the sentence so we can understand the meaning of the next word. Well this is exaclty what a recurrent neural network is designed to do. When we say recurrent neural network all we really mean is a network that contains a loop. A RNN will process one word at a time while maintaining an internal memory of what it's already seen. This will allow it to treat words differently based on their order in a sentence and to slowly build an understanding of the entire input, one word at a time.\n","\n","This is why we are treating our text data as a sequence!

LSTM\n","The layer we dicussed in depth above was called a *simpleRNN*. However, there does exist some other recurrent layers (layers that contain a loop) that work much better than a simple RNN layer. The one we will talk about here is called LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). This layer works very similarily to the simpleRNN layer but adds a way to access inputs from any timestep in the past. Whereas in our simple RNN layer input from previous timestamps gradually disappeared as we got further through the input. With a LSTM we have a long-term memory data structure storing all the previously seen inputs as well as when we saw them. This allows for us to access any previous value we want at any point in time. This adds to the complexity of our network and allows it to discover more useful relationships between inputs and when they appear. \n","\n","For the purpose of this course we will refrain from going any further into the math or details behind how these layers work.\n","\n","![LSTM.png](attachment:b87fda36-0434-49c7-b21e-ebfa3bcfeb2d.png)\n","\n","*Source:https://paperswithcode.com/method/lstm/ *\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bc927341","metadata":{"id":"CRGOx6_v4eZ_","papermill":{"duration":0.020214,"end_time":"2022-07-23T05:21:35.02392","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-07-23T05:21:35.003706","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Sentiment Analysis\n","And now time to see a recurrent neural network in action.
