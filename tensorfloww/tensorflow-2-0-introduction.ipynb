Internally, TensorFlow represents tensors as n-dimensional arrays of base datatypes.\" (https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tensor)\n\nIt should't surprise you that tensors are a fundemental apsect of TensorFlow. They are the main objects that are passed around and manipluated throughout the program. Each tensor represents a partialy defined computation that will eventually produce a value. TensorFlow programs work by building a graph of Tensor objects that details how tensors are related. Running different parts of the graph allow results to be generated.\n\nEach tensor has a data type and a shape. \n\n**Data Types Include**: float32, int32, string and others.\n\n**Shape**: Represents the dimension of data.\n\nJust like vectors and matrices tensors can have operations applied to them like addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product etc.\n\nIn the next sections we will discuss some different properties of tensors.
